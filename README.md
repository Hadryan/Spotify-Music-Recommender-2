## SUBJECT OF MACHINE LEARNING BREAKDOWN
After cleaning and our data, we then started preprocessing and feature engineering our data which is an essential part in machine learning before clustering. We scaled our data with standradscaler from sklearn to make sure that all variables are standardized and made sure all features are normalized so our predictions could make sense and our results will be cohesive.  We then used an elbow plot to determine the number of clusters in our dataset and by looking at the curve our analysis showed that our dataset consists 500 clusters. We then used the Kmeans model also known as k nearest neighbors which based on Cluster with the nearest mean.  To predict to which cluster a given observation belong to. After training our model we then tested our model and ran it with 500 new samples with an accuracy of % (whatâ€™s our accuracy?) meaning that in % (with this accuracy percentage) our prediction will be successful.
