# Spotify Music Recommender --- Machine Learning Analysis with Data Visualizations
Website: [tracks data from Kaggle (Spotify API)](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=artists.csv)


## SUBJECT OF MACHINE LEARNING BREAKDOWN
After cleaning and the data, the data was preprocessed and feature engineered which is an essential part in machine learning before clustering. The data was scaled with standradscaler from sklearn to make sure that all variables are standardized and made sure all features are normalized so the predictions could make sense and the results would be cohesive.  An elbow plot was used to determine the number of clusters in the dataset and by looking at the curve the analysis showed that the dataset consists 500 clusters. A Kmeans clustering model also known as k nearest neighbors was used to predict to which cluster a given observation belong to. After training the model, the model was tested and ran with 500 new samples.
